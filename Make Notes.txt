Making TC.jar

I currently compile the source code with:

	java version "1.8.0_144"
	Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_144-b01)
	Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.144-b01, mixed mode)

then build the TC.jar file by executing the MakeTCJar.command

The gnu folder contains the classes for the RXTX library that handles serial communication with the transmitter.
